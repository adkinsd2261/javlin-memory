Prompt: Implement Immersive Javlin Onboarding with Full-Canvas Avatar

1. Trigger Onboarding Seamlessly
When user clicks “Start Creating”, transition the entire workspace to onboarding mode—fade out background, bring the Javlin avatar to center stage.

Smooth, modern transitions (fade/slide/scale, not jump cuts).

2. Animated Avatar Introduction
Javlin avatar appears front and center, glowing and animated.

Avatar “breathes”, pulses, or animates in sync with the onboarding steps.

Consider “voice” (TTS) or typewriter text effect for added presence.

3. Guided Interactive Tour
Javlin introduces itself (“Hey, I’m Jav, your creative AI partner!”).

Walks the user through core concepts:

How to interact (“Try saying hello!”)

Modes: Creative & Dev, and how to switch

Memory system: “Everything you build here becomes part of your creative journey.”

Where to find features (e.g., quick actions, floating orb, switching modes)

Shows live demo/animation for each feature (e.g., avatar pulses when “listening”).

4. Mini-Quests or Challenges (Optional, but powerful)
Encourage user to “try” actions:

“Send a message to Jav!”

“Switch to Dev mode.”

“Recall your last memory.”

Give real feedback for each step (avatar glows, congratulates, animates).

5. Personalized Wrap-Up
End with a warm, animated welcome and “Let’s get started!” button.

Fade workspace back in with Jav avatar in its usual place.

6. Polish & Details
Everything should feel premium:

Responsive, beautiful, and a bit magical.

No cramped UI—full-screen focus, but never overwhelming.

Allow users to replay onboarding or skip at any time.

Goal:

“Wow” first impression: users feel like they’re meeting Jav, not just using another tool.

Clear, confident understanding of how to get the most out of the platform.

Makes memory, creativity, and Jav’s presence core to the journey—not just features.

Need sample animation specs, script, or onboarding flow? Ask!

Why this matters:
“You never get a second chance to make a first impression.”

This will be the “Siri moment” for Jav—where the tool becomes a living creative companion.

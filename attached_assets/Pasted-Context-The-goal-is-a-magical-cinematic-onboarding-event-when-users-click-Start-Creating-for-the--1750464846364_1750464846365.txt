Context
The goal is a magical, cinematic onboarding event when users click “Start Creating” for the first time—not a sidebar, static text, or generic modal.

The onboarding is our “Siri moment”: a full-canvas, animated introduction that wows new users, tells the story, and fits perfectly with our dark, minimal, neon-accented deep-work workspace.

The Jav avatar must feel alive, expressive, and center-stage—not cropped, static, or generic.

Onboarding is not just instruction—it’s a demonstration of our product’s vision, brand, and unique value (memory, dual mode, creative partner, etc).

What’s Missing (Based on Current Build & Screenshot)
The current onboarding is not immersive:

Avatar is cropped, not center-stage, not animated in a meaningful way.

Layout is generic with too much empty space, basic fonts, and no premium design cues.

Progress indicators (dots) look unstyled, not part of our visual language.

No demo/animation of core features (memory, mode switching, live avatar reactions).

No clear brand DNA: onboarding doesn’t reflect the magic, creativity, or “living workspace” vision.

What To Do (Step-by-Step Implementation Guide)
1. Center-Stage Animated Avatar
Avatar must be perfectly centered (both axes), scaled up (2.5x), and always fully visible—never cropped at the top.

On start, avatar animates in (scale, glow, particle effects, breathing pulse).

Avatar “reacts” to each onboarding step (e.g., happy for intro, focused for dev, sparkly for creative, animated for “memory” step).

2. Cinematic Full-Canvas Overlay
Use a full-viewport overlay (not a sidebar or generic modal).

Background should:

Fade out or blur the workspace beneath.

Use deep, layered gradients—never flat purple or black.

Subtle movement (animated noise, shimmer, glow, or light sweep).

3. Premium Typography and Layout
Headline is large, animated (typewriter or gradient reveal), in our chosen premium font, with on-brand color gradients.

Body copy is clean, slightly larger, with increased line height—never generic browser styles.

“Try saying hello” is interactive—avatar could wave or pulse on this step.

No huge empty space—elements are visually balanced and connected.

4. Branded Progress Indicators
Progress steps are visually integrated (e.g., orbiting or beneath the avatar, with animated progress bar or glow).

Each step’s transition animates smoothly (slide, fade, or scale in).

5. Show, Don’t Tell
For each major feature:

Memory: show an animated “memory spark” flowing into a timeline or card (“Every idea becomes a memory!”).

Creative/Dev Modes: avatar changes expression or color accent, quick demo of mode switch.

Workspace Callouts: animate a “spotlight” to show where chat, memory, and quick actions live.

Shortcuts: animate keyboard overlay or highlight relevant UI elements.

Each onboarding step includes a live demo or animation, not just text.

6. Seamless Exit & Integration
Onboarding always ends with a smooth transition:

Avatar “floats” to docked state or corner.

Workspace fades in with a light sweep.

“You’re ready to create!” message.

Remember onboarding state so returning users skip the cinematic and land directly in their workspace.

7. Polish & Brand Consistency
Colors, gradients, fonts, and shadows must be from our style guide—never default or out-of-place.

Avatar and onboarding animations use same visual system as main workspace.

All micro-interactions are smooth (easing, not jumpy).

Why This Matters
First impressions define our brand—this is our chance to create delight and clarity from the first click.

The onboarding should demonstrate (not just explain) our core product advantages: memory, creative/developer duality, and the living, supportive AI.

Consistency with our site theme, color palette, and animation quality is essential—no generic elements.

Call To Action
Please review and reimplement the onboarding flow using this blueprint. Reference our Figma/style guide for typography, color, and component examples. Onboarding must feel like a cinematic event—centered, premium, expressive, and magical. If you need motion/animation examples, request a demo or reference the Siri/Apple onboarding inspiration.

Avatar: Always full, centered, expressive, animated.

Layout: Full-screen, immersive, on-brand gradients/blur/movement.

Steps: Animate in/out, integrate progress, show features with live demos/callouts.

Exit: Smooth transition, avatar floats to dock, workspace fades in.

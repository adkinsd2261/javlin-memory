Jav Onboarding Event — Implementation Blueprint
Goal:
Implement a cinematic, animated onboarding event presented by Jav, fully integrated with our dark, minimal, neon-accented workspace. This must feel like a seamless, magical “meeting Jav” experience—not a popup, modal, or generic tour.

1. Onboarding Launch Mechanism
Trigger:
When user clicks “Start Creating” (or first visit), fade out workspace content gently.

Canvas Overlay:
Render a full-screen overlay (position: fixed, z-index: 9999) with dark semi-transparent background, matching our site’s deep hue.

Avatar Centerpiece:
Jav’s animated avatar appears at the center (2.5x normal size), with breathing/pulse glow using the site’s primary neon gradient.

2. Cinematic Avatar Animation
Breathing / Idle:
Use @keyframes or Framer Motion for smooth pulse—soft glow radiates outward, subtly shifts hue (no rapid/harsh effects).

State Animations:

Intro: Jav “wakes up” with a gentle scale+fade+glow.

Excited: Slight hop/bounce + brighter glow.

Listening: Soft shimmer, maybe a “listening ring” pulse.

Theme:
Use the same color palette, box-shadow, and border-radius as existing site elements.

3. Interactive, Animated Story Flow
Typewriter/Reveal Text:
Large headline (“Welcome! I’m Jav. Ready to create together?”), animated in with a typewriter or fade-in effect.

Animated Progress Steps:
Below the avatar, display 4-6 progress dots or a progress bar—styled with our neon/gradient.

Step-by-Step Guide:
For each feature (memory, creative/dev mode, quick actions, shortcuts, etc.):

Jav animates to express excitement or “points” at demo.

Highlight relevant workspace area with an animated border/glow (e.g., highlight memory count, mode switcher, etc.).

Accompany with concise microcopy and actionable tip (e.g., “Switch modes any time with this button!”).

Use Next/Back buttons, large, rounded, and on-brand.

4. Seamless Workspace Integration
Smooth Transitions:
Each onboarding step smoothly transitions (opacity, scale, or slide) instead of hard cuts or pop-ins.

Live Demo:
When showing “mode switching” or “memory flow,” animate the actual UI elements (or demo versions) so users see how they’ll interact for real.

Dismiss/Skip:
Prominently display a “Skip intro” (text link, bottom right)—never block user’s flow.

Onboarding End:
Final message from Jav (“Let’s build something together!”), then avatar smoothly shrinks/fades into its normal corner position; main workspace fades back in.

5. Technical Hints (React/JS/HTML/CSS)
Overlay:
Use a dedicated onboarding component (e.g., <JavOnboarding />) rendered conditionally.

Avatar Animation:
Framer Motion or GSAP for smooth scale, glow, and movement.

Workspace Highlight:
Use absolute-positioned translucent borders/divs to “call out” features behind the overlay (with a drop-shadow glow effect).

Progress Steps:
Flex container, on-brand neon gradient for active step, subtle for inactive.

Responsiveness:
Center everything, max-width 700px, plenty of vertical breathing room.

6. Always On-Brand, Never Distracting
Minimal, deep work:
Plenty of empty space, no excessive clutter.

Never break theme:
No “off the shelf” modals or generic illustration styles.

Copy:
Use warm, brief, inviting text. Jav speaks like a partner, not a bot.

References
Design inspiration:
Apple onboarding, Notion’s onboarding, modern “hero” landing pages.

Existing product elements:
Use same shadows, gradients, border-radius, typography as the current workspace.

If you need copy for each step or have any UI questions, ask me!
Every implementation detail should look and feel like it was always part of this product, not bolted on.

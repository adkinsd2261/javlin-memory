The current “Start Creating” onboarding is NOT matching the required cinematic experience:

There is NO full-canvas overlay, animation, or multi-step onboarding.

The avatar does not appear in the center, breathe, or animate through steps.

The onboarding is just a chat sidebar—not a cinematic or guided event.

No transitions, no progress, no workspace highlighting—none of the experience outlined in the blueprint.

What needs to be implemented (reference the blueprint):

When “Start Creating” is clicked:

Fade out (or blur) the main workspace

Present a full-canvas overlay (z-index 9999), covering all UI

Center the animated Jav avatar (2.5x size), glowing and breathing

Animated, Step-by-Step Story:

Display animated welcome text (“typewriter”/fade-in) below the avatar

Show 4-6 progress dots or a progress bar below the headline

Each step:

Jav animates differently (idle, excited, listening, etc.)

Relevant part of workspace is highlighted (with a glow/outline if possible)

Concise, on-brand tip for that step (“Here’s memory search, here’s creative mode,” etc.)

Next/Back buttons, on-brand, with smooth transitions

Final Step:

Jav avatar floats/shrinks to the normal corner position

Overlay fades away, main workspace returns, user is ready to use all features

Skip Option:

Always provide a visible, on-brand “Skip” button/link (bottom or corner)

Technical Implementation Hints
Use a dedicated React component or overlay div for onboarding (conditionally rendered).

Animate avatar with Framer Motion, GSAP, or CSS keyframes.

Overlay must cover the entire workspace (not just right side).

Use consistent gradients, glow, and border-radius for all elements.

Steps and transitions must feel premium—no pop-in modals or sidebar hacks.

Reference
See attached screenshot for current, incorrect implementation.

Refer to this blueprint (paste your previous message or docs) for the target onboarding experience.

The goal is a cinematic, animated “Jav welcomes you” moment, with full-canvas takeover, not a sidebar chat. Please review the implementation, and iterate until the live product actually matches this vision—both visually and interactively.

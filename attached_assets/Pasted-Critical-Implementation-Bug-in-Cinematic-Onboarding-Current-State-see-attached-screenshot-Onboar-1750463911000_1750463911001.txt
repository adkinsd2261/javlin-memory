Critical Implementation Bug in Cinematic Onboarding
Current State (see attached screenshot):

Onboarding overlay is triggered when clicking “Start creating.”

Background animates/fades as expected.

BUT: There is no Jav avatar, no animation, no onboarding script, no steps, no content—just “Close Onboarding.”

For a split second, I see an animation in the background, then it disappears and I’m left with a blank screen.

This is not a timing issue—it’s a rendering/content bug.

What’s Missing:

The main onboarding content is never visible:

Central Jav avatar, breathing/animated (2.5x)

Animated welcome text (“typewriter” headline)

Progress indicators (dots/bar)

Step-by-step onboarding (tips, highlights, animated transitions, next/back)

The “meeting Jav” story and UI walkthrough

How to Fix:

Check conditional rendering and component state:

Ensure the core onboarding component (containing avatar, text, steps) is always mounted inside the overlay, not hidden by default.

Check if state/props are resetting or unmounting after overlay loads.

Look for any JavaScript exceptions that might break rendering after the overlay triggers.

Test for content race condition:

There might be an async or timing bug (e.g. onboarding loads before data/props/animation is ready, so it renders nothing).

Debug by hardcoding onboarding step:

Temporarily set the onboarding step to “Step 1” and ensure the avatar/text are visible, to isolate whether the steps engine is working.

Review onboarding state logic:

Verify the logic for “has seen onboarding” vs “new user” doesn’t instantly skip or hide onboarding content after overlay loads.

Expected Outcome:

When onboarding triggers, users see the full-canvas experience with animated avatar and step-by-step guide, not just a blank overlay and close button.

If you need a reference UI or component tree, let me know.

Extra: If You Want a Quick Debugging Pseudocode

Edit
// Example React structure inside the onboarding overlay
<OnboardingOverlay>
  {currentStep && (
    <AnimatedAvatar state={currentStep.avatarState} />
    <TypewriterText>{currentStep.title}</TypewriterText>
    <StepInstructions>{currentStep.description}</StepInstructions>
    <ProgressDots step={stepIndex} total={totalSteps} />
    <NextBackButtons onNext={...} onBack={...} />
  )}
</OnboardingOverlay>
If currentStep is null/undefined, nothing will show. That’s probably the culprit.

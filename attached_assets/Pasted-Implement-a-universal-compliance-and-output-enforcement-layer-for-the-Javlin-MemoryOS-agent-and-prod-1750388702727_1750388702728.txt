Implement a universal compliance and output enforcement layer for the Javlin/MemoryOS agent and product:

1. **Centralize Output Compliance**
   - Route all agent and system outputs (chat, API, UI, logs, notifications, CLI, emails) through a single compliance module or middleware.
   - In Flask/Python, use a response hook or decorator; in JS, use middleware.

2. **Code Linting & Review Enforcement**
   - Add static code analysis/linter rules that flag any output (e.g., `return`, `print`, `console.log`, direct template render) not piped through the compliance module.
   - Update code review and PR guidelines: no user/log-facing output allowed unless reviewed for compliance.

3. **Comprehensive Output Interface**
   - Define a strict output interface (e.g., `send_user_output(content)` or `log_and_respond(content)`), which always runs compliance checks before anything is displayed or logged.

4. **Automated & E2E Testing**
   - Add tests that mock all endpoints and user flows to ensure every output path fires the compliance check.
   - Break builds or block merges if any output skips the middleware.

5. **System Health/Drift Audits**
   - Build a tool or cron job that scans all outputs, routes, and logs to verify they originate from the compliance module.
   - Surface warnings or errors in system health checks and admin dashboards if bypasses are detected.

6. **Human Bypass Mitigation**
   - Add onboarding reminders, PR templates, and README warnings: “Never claim ‘live’ unless system-verified.”
   - In all system/user-facing logs or statuses, annotate:  
      - “Confirmed by system” (green check)  
      - “Not system-confirmed” (warning)
   - Log any direct/manual status claims for review.

7. **Documentation**
   - Reference AGENT_BIBLE.md and PRODUCT_BIBLE.md as the source of truth for these rules.
   - Document the compliance layer and bypass protection in CONTRIBUTING.md and onboarding.

This ensures all outputs are always product-compliant, no matter the channel or interface, and makes bypassing the compliance contract both visible and auditable.

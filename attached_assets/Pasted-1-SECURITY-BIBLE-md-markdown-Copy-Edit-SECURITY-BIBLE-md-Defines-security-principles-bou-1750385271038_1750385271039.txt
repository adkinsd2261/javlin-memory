# 🔒 SECURITY_BIBLE.md

> **Defines security principles, boundaries, and required practices for all agents, endpoints, and infrastructure in Javlin/MemoryOS.**

---

## 1. Access Control

- Principle of least privilege for all endpoints and agent actions
- No default open ports except documented APIs
- All sensitive routes (task queue, memory export, admin) require authentication

---

## 2. Data Handling

- All logs and memory files stored securely (no public directories)
- No secrets in plain text—use env vars or secure vaults
- Regular audits of memory.json and config files for accidental data leaks

---

## 3. Code and Dependency Security

- All dependencies are tracked in requirements.txt / lockfiles
- Regular `pip audit` or `npm audit` checks
- No unvetted code execution (even from queue/tasks) without human approval

---

## 4. Vulnerability Reporting and Mitigation

- Found a bug? Log in memory, escalate to owner, patch within 72 hours
- If user data ever exposed, report immediately

---

## 5. Changelog

- **2025-06-20 — Initial draft**
2. PRIVACY_POLICY.md

# 🕵️ PRIVACY_POLICY.md

> **Explains user data rights, memory handling, and compliance for all users of MemoryOS/Javlin.**

---

## 1. Data Collected

- Memory logs (structured text, no sensitive info unless explicitly entered)
- Session metadata (timestamps, agent decisions, system health checks)
- No user secrets, passwords, or PII unless opt-in and documented

---

## 2. User Rights

- Users can export or delete their memories at any time via endpoint or request
- All exports are in plain JSON for auditability

---

## 3. Data Retention

- By default, logs are kept for 90 days unless marked for retention
- Old logs are summarized/pruned automatically after 60 days

---

## 4. Compliance

- Designed for basic GDPR/CCPA alignment
- Contact owner for removal or privacy questions

---

## 5. Changelog

- **2025-06-20 — Initial draft**

# 🤝 CONTRIBUTING.md

> **Guidelines for contributing to Javlin/MemoryOS. All contributors must follow system bibles and project rules.**

---

## 1. Onboarding

- Read AGENT_BIBLE.md, MEMORY_BIBLE.md, and PRODUCT_BIBLE.md before submitting code or PRs

---

## 2. Code Guidelines

- Clear, self-documenting Python/JS code preferred
- Use descriptive commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, etc.

---

## 3. PR Workflow

- All PRs require a summary of affected features and reference to related .md “bibles”
- Automated tests required for memory logic and new endpoints
- Run linter and system health checks before submitting

---

## 4. Reporting Issues

- Log bugs as BugFix in memory.json
- Submit issues with clear reproduction steps

---

## 5. Changelog

- **2025-06-20 — Initial draft**

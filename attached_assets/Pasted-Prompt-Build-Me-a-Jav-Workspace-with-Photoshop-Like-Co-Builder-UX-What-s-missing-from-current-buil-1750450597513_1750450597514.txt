Prompt: Build Me a Jav Workspace with Photoshop-Like Co-Builder UX

What’s missing from current builds:

It still feels like a classic IDE with a chatbot stuck in a sidebar, not like a modern creative tool.

I want the feeling of me and my AI co-builder (Jav) working side by side, not me “using” an assistant.

The main focus should be the code/workspace/canvas, with Jav always accessible—dockable, summonable, but never in the way.

Hideaway/dockable panels for project memory, logs, activity, tests, health—just like Photoshop’s panels/tools/history—so I can pull them up or hide them with a click.

Jav is always context-aware: when I open a file, edit code, run a test, or hit an error, Jav appears (or offers to help) right where I’m working, not just in chat.

Smart overlays, pop-outs, and right-click “Ask Jav” options—just like “Inspect” in Photoshop or Figma.

No clutter, no forced chat. Jav’s chat/insights are there when I want them, or when something needs my attention—otherwise, my workspace is all about building.

Every action, memory, and insight is available, but doesn’t crowd the main view—slide-in, fade-out, pin, or float as needed.

Specific Features Needed:

Main code/workspace canvas with minimal distractions.

Jav “avatar” or status always visible; click or shortcut to summon chat/insight panel, which can dock, float, or auto-hide.

Slide-out panels for memory, logs, tests, activity—customizable, resizable, hideable, recallable instantly.

Inline popups/overlays from Jav as I work (“You missed a test here!”), with quick actions or “dismiss” options.

Ability to drag/resize/reorder all panels—like Photoshop or Figma, not a fixed grid.

Keyboard shortcuts to summon/hide Jav, open panels, or perform quick actions.

Workspace remembers my layout, open files, pinned memories, etc. across sessions.

Vibe:

Think: Me and my AI, building together, not me using a “tool.”

Modern, premium, smooth—never clunky, never “old IDE.”

More like Photoshop, Figma, or VS Code with Co-Pilot, but with full agent awareness of everything I do.

If you need a UX wireframe or animation for reference, ask!
Do not deliver another tabbed IDE + chatbot.
I want a “co-builder” experience—Jav is always there, helping me build,
with an environment that puts my work and our partnership first.

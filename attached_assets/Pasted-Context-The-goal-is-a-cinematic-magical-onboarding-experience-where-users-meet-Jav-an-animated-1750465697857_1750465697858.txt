Context:
The goal is a cinematic, magical onboarding experience where users “meet Jav” — an animated, living AI companion — with a full-canvas overlay, flawless center-stage avatar, and smooth, on-brand transitions.

Current State (see screenshot):
The avatar is not visible — just a cropped purple circle at the top.

The title is truncated (“me! I’m Jav. Ready to create to”) and not premium/centered.

Progress dots and “Next” button are low in the viewport, not visually integrated.

No avatar animations or brand-defining magic is visible.

No feature demos, mode-switching, or memory “spark” effects.

Alpine.js/JS errors are causing rendering failures and broken layout.

Skip/close buttons overlap the animation or appear unstyled.

Visual hierarchy is weak; the screen feels unfinished and disconnected from our product's deep-work, premium vibe.

Diagnosis:
Avatar is not implemented as a true living, animated agent. The circle is static, off-center, and cropped.

Text overflows or is truncated due to broken responsive sizing and line limits.

Animations and transitions are missing or broken.

Alpine.js/JS syntax errors in string expressions or rendering guards are halting onboarding logic.

No demonstration of core features (memory, creative/dev mode, shortcut overlays, etc).

How to Fix: Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
Avatar:

Center the avatar perfectly, scale up to 2.5x, and animate with breathing, pulse, and stateful color/particle effects.

Use a <canvas>, SVG, or Lottie for rich animation if needed.

Never crop the avatar — ensure it always fits and is visually “above” the UI.

Typography & Layout:

Use a large, animated title (typewriter or gradient reveal), with proper text wrapping and breakpoints so no overflow/truncation ever occurs.

Center-align all onboarding elements. No crowding or off-center stacking.

Use brand fonts, gradients, and smooth animation timing.

Progress & Navigation:

Place progress dots visually connected to the avatar — orbiting, glowing, or directly beneath, not floating in space.

Animate dot progress, use branded colors/shadows, and synchronize with onboarding steps.

“Next” and “Skip”/“Close” should be styled, non-intrusive, and never overlap the avatar or important content.

Onboarding Steps/Demos:

Each step should animate in smoothly, never “snap” into place.

For each feature (memory, creative/dev mode, quick actions, shortcuts), show the feature with a small live demo/animation. (E.g., memory sparks animate into a timeline, avatar color shifts for mode changes, shortcut hints pop up with keypress animation.)

Each step’s avatar state should match the message (e.g., excited, listening, thoughtful).

Visual Polish & Brand Consistency:

Overlay is full-viewport, with on-brand animated gradients and gentle blur/fade for background focus.

Responsive on all devices: test scaling and stacking on laptop, desktop, and mobile.

Use only our brand palette and spacing system. No generic or default browser styles.

Remove all Alpine.js/JS errors and add defensive guards on step rendering, avatar loading, and text expression parsing.

Onboarding Flow:

Onboarding opens with a magical avatar “awakening” animation (scale, glow, color pulse).

Each step flows into the next with smooth transitions.

On completion, avatar floats to docked corner state, workspace fades in, and the user lands in the creative panel.

Accessibility & QA:

Test all text for truncation, overlap, and readability.

Run onboarding in Chrome and Safari at 1200px, 1024px, 800px, 500px widths.

Confirm all Alpine.js/JS state is clean and no console errors remain.

Actionable To-Do:
Audit your implementation with this checklist, using the attached screenshot as a “what NOT to do” example.

Compare to the original onboarding design prompt.

Fix the avatar, layout, animation, and error-handling as described above.

Deliver a premium, on-brand, magical onboarding event that will wow users and truly showcase what makes this product unique.

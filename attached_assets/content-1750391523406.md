# Javlin Memory Engine

[Permalink: Javlin Memory Engine](https://github.com/adkinsd2261/memoryos#javlin-memory-engine)

Javlin is an open memory system for AI agents, dev tools, and adaptive interfaces.

It uses lightweight `.json` and `.md` files to give your AI workers long-term memory, personalized behavior, and context awareness — without needing a backend.

* * *

## 🧠 What is it?

[Permalink: 🧠 What is it?](https://github.com/adkinsd2261/memoryos#-what-is-it)

Javlin is a portable memory engine built with:

- `memory.json` – structured memory data
- `docs/memory_engine_spec.md` – how agents write/read/update memory
- `roles/*.md` – pluggable role files that define behavior

* * *

## 🔧 How It Works

[Permalink: 🔧 How It Works](https://github.com/adkinsd2261/memoryos#-how-it-works)

Agents use this flow:

1. Load `memory.json` on start
2. Personalize behavior using past data
3. Append new memory on session end

All updates follow the open `memory_engine_spec.md`.

* * *

## 🔁 How Memory Works (Lifecycle)

[Permalink: 🔁 How Memory Works (Lifecycle)](https://github.com/adkinsd2261/memoryos#-how-memory-works-lifecycle)

Each agent session works like this:

1. **Start** – Load the `memory.json` file
2. **Adapt** – Use memory to shape behavior and responses
3. **Append** – Add new memory entries based on what happened
4. **Repeat** – Grow long-term learning over time

This makes the agent feel:

- Personalized
- Evolving
- Context-aware

All entries follow the open schema in `docs/memory_engine_spec.md`.

* * *

## 💼 What’s in This Repo

- `docs/memory_engine_spec.md` – The full open schema
- `examples/memory_output_example.json` – Sample memory entries
- `memory.json` – Live editable memory file
- `roles/javlin_demo_agent.md` – Reference agent role
- `roadmap.md` – WIP roadmap
- `LICENSE.md` – MIT licensed
- `README.md` – You’re reading it

---

## 🧭 Who This Is For

- AI builders (GPT, Claude, Ollama)
- Devs building co-pilots or assistants
- Toolmakers who need persistent agent memory
- Educators or evaluators training AI workers

---

## 🧠 Why This Changes Things

Most AI agents start over every time.
Javlin gives them **memory that lives outside the model.**

That means:
- No backend required
- No vendor lock-in
- No hallucinated context

Just `.json` + `.md` files — readable by devs and GPT alike.

It’s the simplest path to agents that **remember who you are, what you’ve done, and how to help you better** over time.

Prompt Title:
Critical Fixes for Cinematic Jav Onboarding – Follow Video & Screenshot Spec

Context for Devs:
We’re not looking for a basic full-screen message. This onboarding must wow users the first time: it’s a cinematic, animated, “Siri moment” where you meet Jav and learn what makes the workspace special.

Reference: Demo Video Audit
Reference Screenshot: (Paste your earlier screenshots here for context.)

What’s Broken (from video):
Avatar is static, cropped, not “alive.”

Text overlaps and is cut off, especially with big avatar.

No animated transitions, pulsing, or state changes.

Progress and buttons are plain, not visually engaging.

No real onboarding journey (no feature demos, no guided interaction).

Visual polish and responsive design are not premium.

What to Deliver:
A. Cinematic, Animated Centerpiece
Center the avatar, never cropped.

Add breathing/pulse (smooth scale + glow), animated color gradient, and “avatar states” (excited, listening, etc).

Avatar “awakens” with a bounce and glow on first load.

B. Premium Text & Layout
Headline never overlaps avatar.

Large gradient title, responsive font scaling, premium letter spacing.

Typewriter effect on first headline, then smooth fade for subtitles.

C. Onboarding Steps with Feature Demos
Each onboarding step = 1 clear, visually distinct screen (no text wall).

Feature demos:

Step 2: Show fake chat bubble with animated Jav response.

Step 3: Show “dev/creative mode” toggle with animated panel or badge.

Step 4: Memory system preview (timeline or sparkles).

Step 5: Keyboard shortcut overlay, animated.

Use overlays, callouts, or fake floating UI elements for the above.

D. Animated Progress & Controls
Animated glowing dots, premium-styled buttons.

Back/Next/Skip always clear and visually polished.

E. Brand & Theme Consistency
All backgrounds use dark-to-purple gradient with a moving glow.

Only neon colors are Jav and call-to-action (everything else muted).

Keep deep work vibe—never visually “loud,” always smooth, elegant.

F. Responsive & Robust
Test all browser sizes: never cropped/cut off, always beautiful.

Buttons, text, and avatar scale smoothly on mobile/tablet/desktop.

Debugging Checklist (for Dev QA)
No console errors, especially from Alpine.js (fix all expression/escaping bugs).

Avatar always visible, animated, and never cropped.

Headline/title always readable, never cut off.

All onboarding steps advance smoothly with animations.

Responsive at all common browser widths.

“Connect the Dots” Implementation Advice
Use a single x-data Alpine.js root for onboarding.

Animate with CSS transitions, keyframes, or a library like GSAP if needed.

Control avatar state with Alpine transitions, not just static class binding.

Use “fake” panels for step demos (don’t need to hook into real backend—just show the magic!).

Modularize: one “step” = one component/template for clarity.

Summary for Devs
This onboarding must create a “wow” moment that introduces Jav as an animated, creative, and alive companion—not just a chatbot. Follow the video audit and design blueprint to the letter: if it doesn’t look premium, alive, and magical on the first run, it’s not done.
